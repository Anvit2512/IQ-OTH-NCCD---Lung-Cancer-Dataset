🫁 Lung Cancer Detection (Multi-Class Classification)
This project focuses on the early detection of lung cancer by classifying CT scan images into three categories:

Benign Cases

Normal Cases

Malignant Cases

Using deep learning techniques and the IQ-OTH/NCCD - Lung Cancer Dataset, the model achieves exceptional performance with high accuracy and class-wise precision.

🔬 Objective
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early detection is critical to increase survival rates. This project aims to:

Build a deep learning model that can accurately classify CT scans.

Assist radiologists and healthcare professionals with quick and reliable diagnostics.
